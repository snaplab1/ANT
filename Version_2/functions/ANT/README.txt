Instructions/notes for analyzing ANT data with "TrialTime.m" function
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements/Dependencies
- You will need to have both Octave and Matlab installed on your machine.

1) first you must run the "ANT_Oct2Mat.m" script ***IN OCTAVE***
    - This step is required because of an idiotic quirk/bug in Octave that
    resulted in it creating .mat files that cannot be read by Matlab..
    - effectively, this script just opens the .mat files in octave and 
    saves them in a format readable by matlab.. ugghh rediculous I know..

2) Then you can run the "TrialTime.m" ***IN MATLAB***
